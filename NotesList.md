#List of Notes from Tutorials

|Title|Description|
|-----|-----|
|[Add model from model database](https://github.com/mperez13/ROS-Tutorials/blob/master/gazebo_notes/add_model_from_model_database.md)|Add model to Gazebo from Gazebo's online database|
|[Add a sensor to a Robot](https://github.com/mperez13/ROS-Tutorials/blob/master/gazebo_notes/add_sensor_to_robot.md)|create composite models directly from other models in the Gazebo Model Database by using \<include> tags and \<joint> to connect different components of a composite model.|
|[Attach a Mesh as a Visual](https://github.com/mperez13/ROS-Tutorials/blob/master/gazebo_notes/attach_meshes_notes.md)|Meshes can add realism to a model both visually and for sensors. The most common use case for a mesh is to create a realistic looking visual|
|[Make a Mobile Robot](https://github.com/mperez13/ROS-Tutorials/blob/master/gazebo_notes/make_a_mobile_robot.md)|Tutorial demonstrates Gazebo's basic model management & basic model representation inside the model databse by taking the user through the process of creating a two wheeled mobile robot that uses a differential drive mechanism for movement|
|[Model Structure and Requirements](https://github.com/mperez13/ROS-Tutorials/blob/master/gazebo_notes/model_structure_and_requirements_notes.md)|Tutorial describes Gazebo's model directory structure and the necessary files within a model directory|
|[Sensor Noise Model](https://github.com/mperez13/ROS-Tutorials/blob/master/gazebo_notes/sensor_noise_model_info.md)| To present a more realistic environment, need to add noise to the data generated by Gazebo's sensors|
|[Sensor Noise](https://github.com/mperez13/ROS-Tutorials/blob/master/gazebo_notes/sensor_noise.md)|Add sensor noise to Velodyne model in order to improve the output from the sensor|
|[Create SDF Model of the Velodyne Sensor](https://github.com/mperez13/ROS-Tutorials/blob/master/gazebo_notes/velodyne_gazebo.md)|Base on the Velodyne documentation, create basic .sdf file to model the sensor|
|[Model Appearance](https://github.com/mperez13/ROS-Tutorials/blob/master/gazebo_notes/model_appearance_notes.md)|Improve the Velodyne model's appearance by creating meshes|
|[Control Plugin](https://github.com/mperez13/ROS-Tutorials/blob/master/gazebo_notes/control_plugin.md)|Create a plugin in a new directory. The contents of this directory will include the plugin source code, and CMake build script|
|[Connect to ROS](https://github.com/mperez13/ROS-Tutorials/blob/master/gazebo_notes/connect_to_ROS.md)|Use the plugin to connect to ROS. Plugin will be loaded as usual and will listen on ROS topic for incoming float messages, that will be used to set Velodyne's rotational speed|
|[Topic Subscription](https://github.com/mperez13/ROS-Tutorials/blob/master/gazebo_notes/topics_subscription.md)|Simple listener example involving Gazebo|
