#[Sensors][1]

A simulated sensor analyzes the environment and produces a data stream that closely matches the sensor's physical counterpart. These tutorials describe how to use and modify sensors.

|Title|Description|Notes|
|----|----|----|
|[Sensor Noise Model][3]| To present a more realistic environment, need to add noise to the data generated by Gazebo's sensors||
|[Contact Sensor][4]|Create a contact sensor and get contact data via a plugin or a message. Contact sensor detects collisions between 2 objects & reports location of the contact associated forces.|The model is a simple cube not moving. The file are located [here][5]|
|[Camera Distortion][6]|When using camera, the image is distorted and can be fixed by adjusting the distortion coefficients model.sdf file|Shows the image view of a camera in Gazebo through the topic visualization.|
