#[Build a Robot][1]

The following tutorials describe how to build and modify a robot. Included are examples of building a wheeled robot, attaching sensors, attaching actuators, and animating a model.

|Title|Description|Notes|
|----|----|----|
|[Model Structure and Requirements][5]|Tutorial describes Gazebo's model directory structure and the necessary files within a model directory||
|[How to Contribute a Model][27]||*NOT DONE*|
|[Make a Model][3]||*NOT DONE*|
|[Make a Mobile Robot][7]|Tutorial demonstrates Gazebo's basic model management & basic model representation inside the model databse by taking the user through the process of creating a two wheeled mobile robot that uses a differential drive mechanism for movement|*NOT DONE*|
|[Import Meshes][28]||*NOT DONE*|
|[Attach a Mesh as a Visual][3]| Meshes can add realism to a model both visually and for sensors. The most common use case for a mesh is to create a realistic looking visual||
|[Add a sensor to a Robot][2]|Create composite models directly from other models in the Gazebo Model Database by using \<include> tags and \<joint> to connect different components of a composite model.||
|[Make a Simple Gripper][29]||*NOT DONE*|
