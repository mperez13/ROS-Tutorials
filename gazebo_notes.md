|Get Started|[Gazebo Components][24]|This page describes each of the items involved in running a Gazebo simulation|*NOT DONE*|
|Get Started|[Gazebo Architecture][25]||*NOT DONE*|
|Get Started|[Capture Screenshot][26]||*NOT DONE*|
|Build a Robot|[Model Structure and Requirements][5]|Tutorial describes Gazebo's model directory structure and the necessary files within a model directory||
|Build a Robot|[How to Contribute a Model][27]||*NOT DONE*|
|Build a Robot|[Make a Model][29]||*NOT DONE*|
|Build a Robot|[Make a Mobile Robot][4]|Tutorial demonstrates Gazebo's basic model management & basic model representation inside the model databse by taking the user through the process of creating a two wheeled mobile robot that uses a differential drive mechanism for movement||
|Build a Robot|[Import Meshes][28]||*NOT DONE*|

||[Add model from model database][1]|Add model to Gazebo from Gazebo's online database||
||[Sensor Noise Model][6]| To present a more realistic environment, need to add noise to the data generated by Gazebo's sensors||
||[Sensor Noise][7]| Add sensor noise to Velodyne model in order to improve the output from the sensor||
||[Create SDF Model of the Velodyne Sensor][8]| Base on the Velodyne documentation, create basic .sdf file to model the sensor||
||[Model Appearance][9]| Improve the Velodyne model's appearance by creating meshes||
||[Control Plugin][10]| Create a plugin in a new directory. The contents of this directory will include the plugin source code, and CMake build script||
||[Connect to ROS][11]| Use the plugin to connect to ROS. Plugin will be loaded as usual and will listen on ROS topic for incoming float messages, that will be used to set Velodyne's rotational speed|Connect ROS w/ Gazebo through the command line|
||[Topic Subscription][12]| Simple listener example involving Gazebo||
||[Building a World][13]| Creating a world with both static and dynamic objects|This inlcludes adding objects, position models (translation, rotation, scale), save/load world, delete models|
||[Modifying a World][14]|How to modify global properties including scene and physics properties||
||[Digital Elevation Models][15]|3D representation of a terrain's surface that does not include any objects like buildings or vegetation|[Have not finished going through tutorial] This might be useful once we have a simulation of a flying drone completed|
||[Contact Sensor][16]|Create a contact sensor and get contact data via a plugin or a message. Contact sensor detects collisions between 2 objects & reports location of the contact associated forces.|The model is a simple cube not moving. The file are located [here][17]|
||[Plugins 101][18]|Overview of Gazebo Plugins||
|[Model Plugins][19]|Plugins allow complete access to the physical properties of models and their underlying elements (links, joints, collision objects)|Model is a type of plugin. A world containing a model(box), which moves after play button is pressed in the GUI.|
||[System Plugin][20]|create system plugin for gzclient designed to save images into the directory|System is a type of plugin. Saved images are a snapshot of what is done in gazebo while gzserver is running|
||[Programmatic World Control][21]|This plugin example programmatically modifies gravity.|When a box is added, it flies up.|
||[World Plugin][22]|This tutorial demonstrates how to insert predefined and custom models into Gazebo.||
