#Improve Velodyne Model Appearance 

Link to tutorial - http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?cat=guided_i&tut=guided_i2

- Simulated cameras that feed info to vision processing algorithms will benefit from models that appear realistic as well.
- Velodyne has a [STEP file]()
- Gazebo can only use STL or Collada files, so we'll have to convert this file & then add it to our model.
