#[Sensors][1]

A simulated sensor analyzes the environment and produces a data stream that closely matches the sensor's physical counterpart. These tutorials describe how to use and modify sensors.

|Title|Description|Notes|
|----|----|----|
|[Sensor Noise Model][3]| To present a more realistic environment, need to add noise to the data generated by Gazebo's sensors||
|[Contact Sensor][16]|Create a contact sensor and get contact data via a plugin or a message. Contact sensor detects collisions between 2 objects & reports location of the contact associated forces.|The model is a simple cube not moving. The file are located [here][17]|
|[Camera Distortion][48]||*NOT DONE*|
